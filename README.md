Hello! Welcome to my collection of Data Visualization in the World of Sports



This is where I plan to keep all my data visualizations that I do over time with regards to Sports. 

It is neatly organized into folders, and there are screenshots included with every script I made



This will be predominantly R, but it depends.



Thank you, and I hope you enjoy these!
